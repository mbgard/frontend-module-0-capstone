# CHAPTER 2

### How do you declare a variable? What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?
You declare a variable by first giving it a name (identifier).
The equals sign says that you are going to assign a value to the variable.
This is called an assignment operator.

### Numbers, Strings, and Booleans:
NUMBERS numerical data type that handles numbers
STRINGS letters and other characters representing tex
BOOLEANS data type containing one of two values: true or false

### Six rules for naming variables:
1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or underscore
2. Can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or underscore. CANNOT include a dash or period.
3. Cannot use KEYWORDS (special words that tell the interpreter to do something) or RESERVED words (words that may be used in a future version of JS)
4. All variables are case sensitive.
5. Use a name that describes the kind of info the variable stores.
6. camelCase. Capital letter for each word AFTER the first.

### How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?
ARRAY stores a list of values.
To ACCESS a value, you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets.
To CHANGE a value, select it and assign a new value using the equals sign and the new value for that item.

### What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
EXPRESSIONS evaluate into a single value.
STATEMENTS complete line of code that performs an action

### What are three types of operators and how are they used?
ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS assign a value to a variable
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS perform basic math
STRING OPERATORS combine two strings
